            The quadriceps(quads) are a group of four muscles located at the front of your thigh, responsible for extending the knee and stabilizing the hip. Strong quads are essential for running, jumping, squatting, and overall lower-body strength

Two types of exercises to build bigger quads 
Lower body compound exercise and isolation exercise. For compound exercises try to focus on high bar squat variations because it emphasise your quads. 

I would recommend 1-3 workouts a week lean towards 2 but 3 max so u can avoid disporpotionate quads


Lower compound exercises: 
Weighted or unweighted Squat/ front squat/leg press hack squat 


Isolation exercises:
Leg Extention
